     <p> It all started in 2013 when a good friend of mine introduced me to web development. We started learning HTML, and quickly after I got into CSS, at that point I was mind blown by it's power!
    
      A few months later, I created a Freelancer account and started bidding on different jobs there. Some of the clients liked my work so I got myself few long-time gigs.
    
            I started learning jQuery to enhance my "web powers", but after a while, realizing that jQuery is built on top of JavaScript, I dropped it and started learning Vanilla JS, and when I felt that I understood what is going on under the hood, I picked ReactJS to help me on the long run on the front-end. I also added NodeJS (back-end) to my skills palette so I could provide Full-Stack JavaScript services. :)
    
          I later switched to Upwork as they seem to care more about their freelancers.
    
            I also love creating tutorials on various topics ranging from: how to create different Web Components or Web Applications to how to solve Coding Challenges (mostly in JavaScript). You can find out more about these on my blog.
    
          PROVIDING VARIOUS SERVICES
        Improving the web since 2013
      As mentioned above, I'm specialized in HTML/CSS and JavaScript on the frontend, but I'm pretty comfortable with ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, Firebase, Wordpress, PHP, etc. For more details about my completed projects check out my CodePen, Github, Upwork and Freelancer profiles.
    
          See the Timeline for an overview of my progress and accomplishments so far.

        <p> Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we communicate with computers. Code tells a computer what actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set of instructions. By learning to write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way. You can use this skill to make websites and apps, process data, and do lots of other cool things.</p>
